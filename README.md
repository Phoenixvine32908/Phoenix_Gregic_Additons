Most assets and code are licensed under LPGL 3.0 as I use code/assets from other wonderful creators

However for the code involving cleanroom and hpca componet parts, these are an exception as these are licensed under MIT

There is currently a bug if you decide to only use jei (Not present if you use emi or jei+emi). The recipes won't show up *gasp*. To fix it all you need to do is pop the below example into your Kubejs/client_scripts folder.

```js title="manual_recipe_showing_fix.js"
JEIEvents.addItems(event => {
    event.add('phoenix_gregic_additons:active_phoenix_cooling_component')
    event.add('phoenix_gregic_additons:advanced_phoenix_computation_component')
    event.add('phoenix_gregic_additons:akashic_coil_block')
    event.add('phoenix_gregic_additons:akashic_zeronium_casing')
    event.add('phoenix_gregic_additons:blazing_cleaning_maintenance_hatch')
    event.add('phoenix_gregic_additons:blazing_filter_casing')
    event.add('phoenix_gregic_additons:high_yield_photon_emission_regulator')
    event.add('phoenix_gregic_additons:perfected_logic')
    event.add('phoenix_gregic_additons:phoenix_computation_component')
    event.add('phoenix_gregic_additons:phoenix_enriched_neutronium_casing')
    event.add('phoenix_gregic_additons:phoenix_heat_sink_component')
    event.add('phoenix_gregic_additons:reliable_naquadah_alloy_machine_casing')
    event.add('phoenix_gregic_additons:space_time_cooled_eternity_casing')
    event.add('phoenix_gregic_additons:true_phoenix_infused_casing')
})
```
